					This is an web-based application that assits scientist in documenting 
					interactions among species. The interactions are based upon scientist
					observations or an academic citation. Once the data has been entered into
					the database, scientist can export the data as a .csv file for use with
					predictive modeling applications or visualization applications. There are
					many features added to emphasis on the ease of use for scientist, admins,
					and data entry specialist

					The current application was built on the work of a team from 
					The University of California at Santa Clara. Their original tool 
					was designed for documenting the food web and interactions of 
					kelp forests off of the California coastline. The current application
					preserves all of the functionality and utility of the original tool 
					while adding the capacity to use it to create food webs for any
					ecosystem. In addition to the expanding of the tool to any ecosystem 
					it also adds enhanced visualization and analysis tools.
